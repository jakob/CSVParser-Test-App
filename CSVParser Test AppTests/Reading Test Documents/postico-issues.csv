Not sure how difficult that might be, but adding an option to go back to that rather than the inline view with the detail sidebar would be awesome\n\nThanks for the great work!\n"", ""user"": {""id"": 103831, ""url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/ccakes"", ""type"": ""User"", ""login"": ""ccakes"", ""html_url"": ""https://github.com/ccakes"", ""gists_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/ccakes/gists{/gist_id}"", ""repos_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/ccakes/repos"", ""avatar_url"": ""https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103831?v=3"", ""events_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/ccakes/events{/privacy}"", ""site_admin"": false, ""gravatar_id"": """", ""starred_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/ccakes/starred{/owner}{/repo}"", ""followers_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/ccakes/followers"", ""following_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/ccakes/following{/other_user}"", ""organizations_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/ccakes/orgs"", ""subscriptions_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/ccakes/subscriptions"", ""received_events_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/ccakes/received_events""}, ""state"": ""open"", ""title"": ""pg Commander-style Detail View"", ""labels"": [{""id"": 223714667, ""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico/labels/enhancement"", ""name"": ""enhancement"", ""color"": ""84b6eb"", ""default"": true}, {""id"": 280024200, ""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico/labels/maybe-later"", ""name"": ""maybe-later"", ""color"": ""fef2c0"", ""default"": false}], ""locked"": false, ""number"": 48, ""assignee"": null, ""comments"": 4, ""html_url"": ""https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/48"", ""assignees"": [], ""closed_at"": null, ""milestone"": null, ""reactions"": {""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico/issues/48/reactions"", ""heart"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""total_count"": 0}, ""created_at"": ""2015-08-17T11:39:24Z"", ""events_url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico/issues/48/events"", ""labels_url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico/issues/48/labels{/name}"", ""updated_at"": ""2016-10-16T15:25:31Z"", ""comments_url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico/issues/48/comments"", ""repository_url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico""}"

The Postico would be clever enough to detect the `{{database}}` placeholder in the code and automatically offer the action in the context menu for databases.  Selecting such an action from the context menu could either bring the SQL editor with the pre-populated query with the placeholder parameters replaced appropriately or execute the query and show the result right away. Perhaps, there could be a checkbox for each custom SQL query to define this behaviour.  Having this feature would remove the burden of maintaining lists of SQL code snippets in files on the disk or in a separate app. Also, this would allow Postico to be extended with many missing features quite easily (such as listing sequences in the database).  Here's another example of such a snippet, which could be used in the context of a table column:  ``` sql -- Show records for which the given column is not a valid email address SELECT * FROM {{database}}.{{table}} WHERE {{column}} !~ '^[A-Za-z0-9._%-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+[.][A-Za-z]+$' ``` ",0,"{""id"": 114095916, ""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico/issues/105"", ""body"": ""It would be great if predefined custom SQL queries (snippets) could be executed in context of specific objects such as databases, tables and columns.

I migrated from heavy pgadmin iii use because this provides a really slick interface and I can finally escape the pgadmin headaches and tableflipping with it's unstable query editor and frequent crashes. \n\nHowever, what I think postico really needs is 1. parenthetical highlighting and 2. clearer debug messages. pgadmin iii has both of these and when working on debugging a complex SELECT query in the editor I find myself copying and pasting into pgadmin query editor to figure out if I have unbalanced parentheses and what position of the query is really causing issues (and why).\n\nIn short, parenthetical highlighting in the editor would go a long way in beefing up this app. I love doing scratch work and experimenting and exploring in postico, but this missing feature sucks. when the queries become sufficiently complex, it's good to be able to click the cursor at a certain parenthesis and have a visually indication in the query window which other parenthesis it is paired with it. Pgadmin does a great job with this and it's a feature that is oft taken for granted, but once it's gone you really wish you had it.\n\nOn a more minor note, the debug messages leave more to be desired. But this would be less of an issue with good query editor syntactic highlights for parenthetical imbalances.\n"", ""user"": {""id"": 8778382, ""url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/chaz9456"", ""type"": ""User"", ""login"": ""chaz9456"", ""html_url"": ""https://github.com/chaz9456"", ""gists_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/chaz9456/gists{/gist_id}"", ""repos_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/chaz9456/repos"", ""avatar_url"": ""https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8778382?v=3"", ""events_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/chaz9456/events{/privacy}"", ""site_admin"": false, ""gravatar_id"": """", ""starred_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/chaz9456/starred{/owner}{/repo}"", ""followers_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/chaz9456/followers"", ""following_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/chaz9456/following{/other_user}"", ""organizations_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/chaz9456/orgs"", ""subscriptions_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/chaz9456/subscriptions"", ""received_events_url"": ""https://api.github.com/users/chaz9456/received_events""}, ""state"": ""open"", ""title"": ""Parenthesis highlighting & debug messages"", ""labels"": [], ""locked"": false, ""number"": 270, ""assignee"": null, ""comments"": 2, ""html_url"": ""https://github.com/jakob/Postico/issues/270"", ""assignees"": [], ""closed_at"": null, ""milestone"": null, ""reactions"": {""+1"": 0, ""-1"": 0, ""url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico/issues/270/reactions"", ""heart"": 0, ""laugh"": 0, ""hooray"": 0, ""confused"": 0, ""total_count"": 0}, ""created_at"": ""2016-09-29T18:06:20Z"", ""events_url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico/issues/270/events"", ""labels_url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico/issues/270/labels{/name}"", ""updated_at"": ""2017-02-14T11:17:55Z"", ""comments_url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico/issues/270/comments"", ""repository_url"": ""https://api.github.com/repos/jakob/Postico""}"

This can be caused by a number of reasons; a possible cause are Firewalls that automatically drop idle connections.  Postico reconnects automatically when the connection is lost. However, sometimes it can take a long time for Postico to detect that a connection is lost. This is especially true for SSH connections (#66). Reducing timeouts is not really an option, since it would cause issues when using Postico over slow connections.  I've tried to address this issue by adding a setting that preemptively disconnects from the server after a period of inactivity, but that has been causing issues with temporary tables and settings like `search_path` (#142).  I believe the best way to go forward is to add a Keep-Alive mechanism to Postico. This would ensure that connections aren't dropped by over-protective firewalls, and it would also allow Postico to detect a lost connection more quickly. Such a keep-alive can be implemented on various levels (TCP, SSH, PostgreSQL). I think the best way to implement it is on the highest level, ie. by sending a no-op query like `SELECT 1;` to the PostgreSQL server -- this way we can be sure everything works.  There is a potential downside to a Keep-Alive mechanism: If you have an unreliable connection with intermittent connectivity, Postico will close the connection, even if the connection issues are only temporary. (Real Live Example: I'm on a train, entering a tunnel. There is no connection inside the tunnel. If Postico tries to send a Keep-Alive query while the train is in the tunnel, it will think the connection is lost, and I will need to reconnect later. Without Keep-Alive, Postico wouldn't ever know that we drove through a tunnel)  Another disadvantage of Keep-Alives is that Postico would need to periodically run code, increasing idle CPU usage. However, I assume that sending a single command to the server eg. once per minute should have minimal impact.
